The campaign was powered by the Twitter platform hashtag’d to link users video and images into galleries for others to share and add. </p><p class="font-light">My role as a lead designer on the project, involved creating designs that had a clear hierarchy, creation of extra modules and UI that matched the parent site, and were within restraints of technical requirements.

							<p class="font-light">With many operations across the world, the websites lacked consistency with each region. TMW Unlimited was asked to come up with a global solution for markets to use. The team adopted a user centered design approach, identifying various personas and their requirements. The design of modules were heavily reviewed and tested throughout. </p><p class="font-light">I was involved in many sprint sessions throughout the project, working closely with UX and Development to be sure our ideas and solutions were possible. Getting an insight into what websites appealed to the client, the initial creative process started with forming three style tiles, to present three possible design routes using that inspiration to get very close to the vision Barilla had in their minds sooner within a very big project. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, and Illustrator. HTML / CSS for presentations during sprints.</p>

							<p class="font-light">For the leadup to Christmas in 2014, I worked with another designer and developer at TMW on a side project to track christmas terms used on twitter. Starting off with a list of words / terms we illustrated many characters and objects best to suit those and then housed them within a scene that zoomed when the user scrolled. To keep everything crisp and sharp our creations were exported as SVG. </p><p class="font-light">The project took around three weeks to produce outside of work, just in time for a launch at the start of december, using Google Drive to share and collaborate with assets. An option to kindly donate to the charity Shelter was also added. Applications and skills used during the project: Illustrator.</p>

							<p class="font-light">To push more ticket sales, the Arrive Awesome campaign covered TV, press, outdoor, social, and digital advertising. Online the campaign resulted in 25 million online impressions, and the campaign on a whole increased revenue by £13.5 million. With my experience in Flash advertising, this was to be my first introduction to HTML banners on the build side. </p><p class="font-light">It was an immense challenge in getting everything to run correctly across multiple devices and multiple browsers, and to match the storyboards exactly. Workarounds and solutions were aplenty, and solving issues was very satisfying. I learnt a great deal about javascript development from this project, while working within the development team, and thankfully have never relied on jQuery again! Applications and skills used during the project: HTML, CSS, SASS, and Javascript.</p>

With a user age range of 18-80 meant ease of use was mandatory across all pages. Colours were contrast checked throughout the design process to cater for as many as possible at AA standard. </p><p class="font-light">A friendly vibe was incorporated into the design with strong use of colour, and SVG Icons that sat with their relative article to avoid lots of FAQ like templates.

Design, UX and development worked closely within a small team over a period of a few months to be seamless in creating the site. </p><p class="font-light">A key requirement was to present the user with information that was considered yet organised, and to avoid being text heavy. Focusing on full bleed imagery to highlight the premium products Infiniti were creating. Clear navigation, easy on the eye, and a strategy to simplify the user journey and to increase user engagement to eventually submitting their information for a possible test drive. User base for the site increased by 26% compared to the previous hub. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, and Illustrator.</p>

Taking the strategy and user journey on how this could be a possibility, my task involved bringing this to life within the design of program landing pages on the main BBC website, while working closely with an Art Director and UX. </p><p class="font-light">I had to balance usability and cosmetics to keep a page looking rich and appealing with full bleed backgrounds, while being easy to use for multiple personas. Keeping the BBC brand and careful consideration to UI and CTA’s. A strong focus on designing for tablet use was a requirement throughout.

A release planned for Europe allowed an opportunity to redesign, and rethink the entire user journey completely, from page layout right down to the UI. Working with an Art Director, and UX helped to keep the balance of a premium yet usable site. </p><p class="font-light">Brand awareness was in union alongside clearly presented cocktail recipes and never overpowering. After launch results were impressive too, 300,000 average visits a month, with 50% of traffic from portable devices, and over 100 social shares a week.

Here users could get an insight into the latest UI of the phone and see all other features and benefits with the product. After experimenting with the handset I went on to design and direct a style that matched the bold colours of the handset and take hints of the UI on the phone’s OS. </p><p class="font-light">CTA’s were treated more like hotspots than buttons, and required a different approach to other microsites previously designed. I supported the Flash developers during the build stage, supplying assets and animating sequences and screens in After Effects. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash, and After Effects.</p>

							<p class="font-light">To advertise the miCoach training app for the iPhone, I was asked to take a concept and make it a reality with designing and building the ad. To entice users into watching the video I added hints of the promo with a few scenes, housed inside the polygon shapes used in other parts of the branding, with various other effects layered over on top. </p><p class="font-light">The masthead placement on YouTube doesn’t match the ratio of the video so a little treatment was added to fill the space on the end sequence to bleed out to white for a neater lockup. Applications and skills used during the project: Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash. Developed in actionScript 3.0.</p>

							<h3 class="font-heavy">Nokia N8</h3>

							<p class="font-light">I was briefed to design, animate, and build a masthead for nokia.com to advertise the new Nokia N8 smartphone. Asset wise for the project, we had access to 3D renders used in the TV adverts, mixing these in with the standard flash animation helped to push the rich ad placement, along with consistency to match the rest of the campaign. </p><p class="font-light">Some random math scripting added some life into the background, with the cubes floating in various velocities throughout the duration.

							<p class="font-light">To direct traffic to the microsite I was involved in some rich ad placements that were expendable on roll over. Using video from various parts of the microsite I comped everything into a flow with cue points to trigger certain titling and text effects. Every aspect of the ad right down to small little UI hints, were designed and animated with as much detail as possible. </p><p class="font-light">File size restrictions on collapsed parts of the placement meant animating a lot of the effects on the side of the shoe with the basic tools in Flash than using sequences or loops of video.

							<h3 class="font-heavy">Royal Marines - Standard Placement</h3>

							<p class="font-light">There was a strict requirement to keep these ads down to a tiny 30kb for the placements. Working with an illustrator to vectorise just about everything,  I had the task of designing and animating the concept compressing everything as much as I could, but still keeping a premium feel to the whole piece. </p><p class="font-light">I had to rely completely on an actionscript tween library to control all the animation, and to minimize file size with avoiding lengthy timelines. Clickthrough rates were higher than the original targets, and the ad itself became an example as to how the agency could push standard ads for future and prospecting clients.

							<p class="font-light">Matching closely to the TV ad spots, this rich media placement would feature the similar heart beat, combined with flashing up images quickly that displayed the kind of service the Royal Marines provide within the elite regiment. Each image randomly forms a grid of thumbnails, gathering intensity before turning over to lead into the end frame sequence. </p><p class="font-light">My involvement focused on taking a simple drawn storyboard scamp and creating that into a fully working ad.
